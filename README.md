### ðŸŽ¬ WHAT?

Alakazam is a search application that can identify the movie you are looking for based on keywords or short samples provided by the user.

Movie industry continues to grow, and as the offer increases, it becomes more difficult to refine searches for specific movies using very little information on the user-side. Whether you are looking for a childhood film that you only remember a side plot or a B movie that you saw in an obscure festival, we can find it for you!

### ðŸŽ¬ HOW?

Using our website or mobile application, users can enter a text input with the information they have about the movie: keywords, actors, director, year, plotâ€¦ you can use anything!
